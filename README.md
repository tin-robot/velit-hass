## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant.
2. Go to **Integrations** and click the three-dot menu in the top right.
3. Select **Custom repositories**.
4. Add `https://github.com/JohnFreeborg/velit-hass` with category **Integration**.
5. Search for **Velit** in HACS and click **Download**.
6. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the `custom_components/velit/` directory into your HA configuration directory:
   ```
   <config>/custom_components/velit/
   ```
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Setup

### Automatic discovery

If your Velit device is powered on and within Bluetooth range, Home Assistant will detect
it automatically and show a notification in **Settings → Devices & Services** prompting
you to complete setup.

### Manual setup

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Search for **Velit**.
3. Enter the Bluetooth address of your device.
4. Select the device type (Heater or Air Conditioner) and give it a name.

## Notes

- The integration communicates directly with the device over Bluetooth. Your HA instance
  must have a Bluetooth adapter within range of the device.
- The physical temperature display unit on the device (°C or °F) is preserved — the
  integration detects the current unit on connect and does not change it. Home Assistant
  handles display conversion based on your system preferences.
- Poll interval is 30 seconds. Commands sent from HA take effect immediately and state
  is refreshed straight after.

## Troubleshooting

**Device not discovered automatically**
- Confirm the device is powered on and within Bluetooth range.
- Close the Velit mobile app on all nearby phones before running setup — the app holds
  the Bluetooth connection and will prevent Home Assistant from finding the device.
- Check that your HA instance has a working Bluetooth adapter (Settings → System → Hardware).
- Try adding the device manually using its Bluetooth address.

**Integration shows unavailable**
- The device may be out of Bluetooth range or powered off.
- If another app (e.g. the Velit mobile app) is connected to the device, the integration
  may not be able to connect. Disconnect the other app and reload the integration.
- Check the HA logs (Settings → System → Logs) for error details.

**Fault sensor shows an error code**
- Fault descriptions are listed on the device page in Home Assistant.
- Refer to your device manual for guidance on each fault type.
- You can build automations to alert on specific fault conditions using the Fault sensor
  as a trigger.
